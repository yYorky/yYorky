that they dont get to order dinner food anymore\\nWe have gone multiple times right after leaving the pinballz arcade just to sit in the parking lot in the DriveThru line waiting while they do nothing but wait for the order menu to change over\\nLook McDonalds if I wanted a breakfast deluxe I wouldnt have shown up at 230 in the morning thank you   \n\n    rating sentiment                actual_date
