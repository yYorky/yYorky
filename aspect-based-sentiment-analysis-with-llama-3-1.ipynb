About 10 minutes go by and there were people overflowing the drivethrough and the indoor registers.  I figured I'd just hang out and just check in every once in a while, since I had nothing pressing to do.\nDozens of orders went through while I was there.  Most of them went through slowly, and a LOT needed substitutions since many products weren't available.  The store's CO2 went down, so they couldn't give out soda.  Bottled drinks were being subbed for soda, shakes being subbed for ice cream, lemonades being subbed for tea.  They were trying with what they had, but what an absolute madhouse...  Listening to the regulars in line, it sounds like this has been common recently.\n\nThis exercise of curiosity went on so long (~an hour) that there seemed to be a shift change.  Two of the new employees got together and figured out my mobile order.  Apparently, mobiles don't process automatically and need some kind of manual start by an employee - which didn't happen the previous times I asked.  Because of this, I'm sure that this doesn't reflect in their service metrics at all.\n\nThe employee that was able to help me asked first for my order number.  The number she was looking for was supposed to be something like '756' or '1691', like you see on your paper receipts.\nHowever, that number is not actually sent to you via the app nor by email.  That sounds like an oversight with mobile ordering, rather than the local store.\nAfter they figured it out, it took maybe 30 seconds to get my food.

The staff are the craziest, rudest, nastiest human beings you will ever experience. They have zero filter. They scream and curse at eachother and the customers.

Also, the McDonald's app has great deals. If you do the survey on the recite than you get a buy one get one free discount.\nSince I have frequented McDonald's for a long time, I must admit that I have mixed sentiments regarding the eatery. On the one side, the meal is typically pretty decent, and I like the quick and convenient service. However, there are some problems that I've come to realize over time that make me feel like the experience isn't as positive as it once was.\n\nThe rising costs of the products on the menu are one of my main worries. Every time I visit McDonald's, it seems like the costs have increased once again. This makes it challenging to continue frequenting them as much as I once did, especially with the availability of more economical fast food alternatives.\n\nAnother problem is that McDonald's used to give frequent and significant discounts and promotions, but lately they seem to be less frequent and generous. This is disappointing because I've always valued the ability to occasionally save a few dollars on my lunch.\n\nHaving said that, there are still a few aspects of McDonald's that I genuinely value. The majority of the cuisine is delicious and good, and the quickness of service is still unmatched. The restaurant is always spotless and well-kept, making it a perfect choice if you need a fast dinner on the run. Overall, I would say that McDonald's is still a good option for fast food, but because of the rising costs and less promotions, it has lost its place as my top pick. However, a typical McDonald's burger and fries are a great choice if you're searching for a quick and delectable dinner.\nGenerated: Analysis:\nservice=[3]\ncleanliness=[3]\nfood=[3]\nprice=[1]\nothers=[1]\nParsed sentiments: {'service': 3, 'cleanliness': 3, 'food': 3, 'price': 1, 'others': 1}\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":" 31%|███       | 778/2532 [32:02<1:14:29,  2.55s/it]","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nItem 777:\nReview: They are good at making McDonald's food\nGenerated: Analysis:\nservice=[0]\ncleanliness=[0]\nfood=[3]\nprice=[0]\nothers=[0]\nParsed sentiments: {'service': 0, 'cleanliness': 0, 'food': 3, 'price': 0, 'others': 0}\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":" 31%|███       | 779/2532 [32:05<1:13:00,  2.50s/it]","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nItem 778:\nReview: While I'm there lots of wrong orders thought they won't mistake mine\nDidn't find put except after I left\nGenerated: Analysis:\nservice=[1]\ncleanliness=[0]\nfood=[0]\nprice=[0]\nothers=[1]\nParsed sentiments: {'service': 1, 'cleanliness': 0, 'food': 0, 'price': 0, 'others': 1}\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":" 31%|███       | 780/2532 [32:07<1:12:27,  2.48s/it]","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nItem 779:\nReview: 5 stars for consistency.

We approached the window , when I gave her my code for my McDonald's Rewards she right away got even more rude with her whole body and facial expressions and didn't want to take my code , but in a very bad mood overall. Her attitude was so unpleasant. Being a McDonald's customer for years, I Didn't appreciate her behavior , she just ruined my whole mood and day. Her manager came to explain to me the situation in a much calmer , respectful manner. I mean, thats all Griselda had to do. Employees like this need to get trained better on how to properly interact with customers. Once you're clocked in, you're clocked in and should be ready to go. Trust me. I know. I've worked in customer service for 18 years.

I still did not see my order at table 101. I went to the counter and asked for it. A lady saw a tag with 101 on the counter and then she prepared for my order, and then gave it to me. I asked her why no one brought me the order. She did not say. Then, I asked for the manager. Then, a gentleman named Armando showed up. I told him what happened. He first told me that they were busy. However, there was no one waiting at the counter. I told the manager that the lady who prepared my order saw my order tag on the counter. Then, the manager changed his explanation. He said that after 7 PM, they don't serve table service. In other words, they don't bring order to the table after 7 PM. I said that the Mcdonald's app says that the table order is still available.

I only feel that the beverage station should be closer to the dining area to facilitate the transfer of drinks from station to table; particularly for the disabled.\nAnother, concern was the price of the food. Though there were \"dollar\" options available, the price of the more popular sizes and items was very high. A median-income family of four would be wary of dining more than once a month, if that often.\nThe name of the counter person that helped us during our visit was Chris.

Several people in-store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold, old or not made correctly. This included us...at 1:00 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold, chewy and seemed old. I would think this wouldn't be the case given 1:00 p.m. is during the lunch rush. Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready. Double cheeseburger was made correctly (no mustard or pickles), but bun was not warm/dry and cheese was cold/not melted. 4 managers were in the kitchen (button-up shirts with ties) along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle-paced, leisurely-stroll walk. I worked at McDonald's and Burger King as a teenager and was always told, \"If you got time to lean, you've got time to clean\", and that was during slow/dead times, not lunch rush. I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to (we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 5-10 minutes for fresh ones) was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one.\nGenerated: Analysis:\nservice=[1]\ncleanliness=[1]\nfood=[1]\nprice=[0]\nothers=[1]\nParsed sentiments: {'service': 1, 'cleanliness': 1, 'food': 1, 'price': 0, 'others': 1}\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":" 93%|█████████▎| 2345/2532 [1:36:34<08:06,  2.60s/it]","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nItem 2344:\nReview: No chocolate shakes available?!

I would give negative stars, if I could. I ordered a to go order, but ended up staying to eat in the dining room.  I opened my quarter pounder hamburger and it was turned upside down with all of the toppings splattered onto the box as if it was slapped in there. It literally had no top hamburger bun, and when I brought this up to the cashier she said that this is what a \"quarter hamburger\" was. When I asked for just a top hamburger bun at least and showed the cashier the burger she didn't even apologize or offer to remake the burger she just snatched the box out of my hands. I paid for this burger and was only asking for the bun, not making a scene or demanding anything or being rude. I had chosen to not acknowledge the mess it was because there are enough verbally abusive patrons. But all the cashier ended up doing was turn the burger right side up (no gloves) and slap an undercooked bun on it, and yell at the other adult woman at the grill about \"what's missing here?\". It wasn't even busy in the drive thru or the dining room. I can't pretend to know their job or lives, but I hope they aren't this effed up to every PAYING customer. I ended up asking for a refund, and not taking the burger, even this was an issue. Please beware!! I only regret not getting their names to report them.
